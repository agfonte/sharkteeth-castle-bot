Go hunting:
/hunt - to recieve notifications on available mobs
/stop - when tired of hunting, to stop notifications

Set security range:
/setminlvl /setmaxlvl - Set minimum/maximum lvl difference between you and mobs you hunt
/sethelpminlvl /sethelpmaxlvl - Set minimum/maximum lvl difference between you and players allowed to help you

Stats:
/mystats - To check state and record progress. You will need to send "You are preparing for a fight" and "Too late" sms for this to work.

            "tutorialmsg": """Mob encounters can appear on forest🌲, valley⛰ or swamp🍄. It consists of a fight against 1 to 3 forbidden players or animals around your lvl.

To participate you must use the link in the message, and you can get help by forwarding that message (You can only be helped by one person per encounter, and it must be 🦈). Helping consumes 1 stamina 🔋. If you don't click this link and no one helps, encounter doesn't occur.

If you win the encounter you will get some extra exp, and the helper will get slightly more exp than a normal quest.

Helping mobs of 10 lvls lower or more can result on the mob running away, in wich case you and your partner won't get exp or rewards.
Helping mobs of 10 lvls higher or more can result on both players death.

Some tips:
🐻Bears are the most dangerous beasts, followed by 🐺wolves.
❤️Try to be safe on health and keep it above 70% of your maximum. 
👥You can start 2 hunts at the same time but is not recommended to do this.
🌟Keep your /hero up to date! Your lvl is important on calculations.
